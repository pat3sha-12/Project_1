# Project_1
A love for cute duck pictures is one of the things this group have in common. They believe in Duck supremacy, hence the creation of the this group, the DUCKLINGS. This group consists of 5 ducklings, namely Patricia Dominique Maliwanag, Kaye Marie Valencia, Aicynth Lee Bandiola, Alzen Maria Castillo, and Cristian Jay Reymund Baterbonia, all are first year students taking up Electrical Engineering. The Ducklings developed a useful calculator not only as a requirement for their programming class, but also a tool they can use as they tread their path to their dream profession in life. The leader of the pack, Patricia Dominique Maliwanag, was the Duckling in charge of the github repository and knowledgeable when it comes to merging different branches in github. She is also in charge with integrating the calculator logic with the UI and writing some test units. The second Duckling, Kaye Marie Valencia, is in charge of writing the calculator GUI. She is in charge of deciding on what python library the Ducklings will be using for their calculator. The third duckling, Aicynth Lee Bandiola, is in charge of writing the calculator logic for the calculator. She will also be participating in writing some test units for the calculator logic, to make sure that the logic is functional. The fourth duckling, Alzen Maria Castillo, is incharge of writing the majority of test units for both the UI and the calculator logic. And the last duckling, Cristian Jay Reymund BAterbonia, is in charge of creating the documentation and will also be participating in writing testunits for both calculator logic and calculator GUI.

Together as a team, they will work hard to deliver their expected outcome: the Calculator.
